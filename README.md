# Sales prospecting tool 

This tool helps you gather potential clients contact information from the internet.


## How it works?

- Chrome extension + Binary executable server which runs locally;
- load extension in browser (edge://extensions/ or chrome://extensions/ then Load unpacked point to chrome-extension folder);
- Start surfing the web for potential clients;
- If you find contact information of a potential client, select text that contains it;
- Right-click to open the modal (based on the url and data you selected a modal with data to fill or update will appear);
- Custom prospect statuses (you'll have some default statuses which you can delete or ignore);
- No duplicate prospects (the url and name are checked in the database before saving);
- Fields are updated automatically based on the text selected and the website you are currently (if fields are not filled correctly you can correct them);
